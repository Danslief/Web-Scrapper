When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".

When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".

Lucky for me, one of my fellow jurors had a wife with some sway where she worked, and when the trial was done, I had a new job waiting for me. <br>It was meant to be. <br>I ended up with my dream job, and the trajectory of my life changed. <br>Life is unpredictable.<br>Finding the person who would be my best friend for the next forty years at that job was a bonus. <br>I\'m pretty glad now that I didn\'t duck jury duty.<br>Tonight\'s sunset looks like more rain on the horizon.<br><a href=""https://sfba.social/tags/Sunset"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>Sunset</span></a></p>LillyLyle/Count Melancholia<p>Chances that a cow steals your shoes are slim, but never zero  [h/t All Things Interesting]</p>Ars Technica<p>Unvaccinated Florida kids exposed to measles can skip quarantine, officials say</p><p>On Tuesday, nearly 20 percent of the school&#39;s 1,067 students were reportedly absent.</p><p><a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no""><span class=""invisible"">https://</span><span class=""ellipsis"">arstechnica.com/science/2024/0</span><span class=""invisible"">2/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social</span></a></p>Chris Hallbeck<p>[Radiohead Creep]</p><p>When you were here before<br />Couldn‚Äôt look you in the eye<br />You‚Äôre shaped like a bunny<br />Your foil makes me cry<br />You‚Äôre sold for $3.50<br />In a beautiful box<br />And I wish I was chocolate<br />You‚Äôre so full of chocolate<br />But I‚Äôm a peep<br />I‚Äôm marshmallow<br />What the hell am I doing here?<br />Wait until Easter</p>John Carlos Baez<p>At first glance it\'s amazing that one of the great British composers of the 1400s largely sank from view until his works were rediscovered in 1850.  </p><p>But the reason is not hard to find.  When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".

Even though I was working, had a side hustle as a seamstress, and had two young children, I ended up on a jury for a murder trial. What a stressful experience.<br>Because I did my civic duty and was off work for several weeks, I lost my job. Lucky for me, one of my fellow jurors had a wife with some sway where she worked, and when the trial was done, I had a new job waiting for me. <br>It was meant to be. <br>I ended up with my dream job, and the trajectory of my life changed. <br>Life is unpredictable.<br>Finding the person who would be my best friend for the next forty years at that job was a bonus. <br>I\'m pretty glad now that I didn\'t duck jury duty.<br>Tonight\'s sunset looks like more rain on the horizon.<br><a href=""https://sfba.social/tags/Sunset"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>Sunset</span></a></p>LillyLyle/Count Melancholia<p>Chances that a cow steals your shoes are slim, but never zero  [h/t All Things Interesting]</p>Ars Technica<p>Unvaccinated Florida kids exposed to measles can skip quarantine, officials say</p><p>On Tuesday, nearly 20 percent of the school&#39;s 1,067 students were reportedly absent.</p><p><a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no""><span class=""invisible"">https://</span><span class=""ellipsis"">arstechnica.com/science/2024/0</span><span class=""invisible"">2/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social</span></a></p>Chris Hallbeck<p>[Radiohead Creep]</p><p>When you were here before<br />Couldn‚Äôt look you in the eye<br />You‚Äôre shaped like a bunny<br />Your foil makes me cry<br />You‚Äôre sold for $3.50<br />In a beautiful box<br />And I wish I was chocolate<br />You‚Äôre so full of chocolate<br />But I‚Äôm a peep<br />I‚Äôm marshmallow<br />What the hell am I doing here?<br />Wait until Easter</p>John Carlos Baez<p>At first glance it\'s amazing that one of the great British composers of the 1400s largely sank from view until his works were rediscovered in 1850.  </p><p>But the reason is not hard to find.  When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".  It has long, sleek lines of harmony; you can lose yourself trying to follow all the parts.</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLrgI6-3I-s"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no"" target=""_blank""><span class=""invisible"">https://www.</span><span class=""ellipsis"">youtube.com/watch?v=qLrgI6-3I-</span><span class=""invisible"">s</span></a></p>Steve Silberman<p>This Doug Muir essay on the long-delayed death of the Voyager 1 spacecraft is an instant classic, one of the most gorgeously written <a href=""https://newsie.social/tags/science"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>science</span></a> pieces you\'ll read all year.

What a stressful experience.<br>Because I did my civic duty and was off work for several weeks, I lost my job. Lucky for me, one of my fellow jurors had a wife with some sway where she worked, and when the trial was done, I had a new job waiting for me. <br>It was meant to be. <br>I ended up with my dream job, and the trajectory of my life changed. <br>Life is unpredictable.<br>Finding the person who would be my best friend for the next forty years at that job was a bonus. <br>I\'m pretty glad now that I didn\'t duck jury duty.<br>Tonight\'s sunset looks like more rain on the horizon.<br><a href=""https://sfba.social/tags/Sunset"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>Sunset</span></a></p>LillyLyle/Count Melancholia<p>Chances that a cow steals your shoes are slim, but never zero  [h/t All Things Interesting]</p>Ars Technica<p>Unvaccinated Florida kids exposed to measles can skip quarantine, officials say</p><p>On Tuesday, nearly 20 percent of the school&#39;s 1,067 students were reportedly absent.</p><p><a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no""><span class=""invisible"">https://</span><span class=""ellipsis"">arstechnica.com/science/2024/0</span><span class=""invisible"">2/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social</span></a></p>Chris Hallbeck<p>[Radiohead Creep]</p><p>When you were here before<br />Couldn‚Äôt look you in the eye<br />You‚Äôre shaped like a bunny<br />Your foil makes me cry<br />You‚Äôre sold for $3.50<br />In a beautiful box<br />And I wish I was chocolate<br />You‚Äôre so full of chocolate<br />But I‚Äôm a peep<br />I‚Äôm marshmallow<br />What the hell am I doing here?<br />Wait until Easter</p>John Carlos Baez<p>At first glance it\'s amazing that one of the great British composers of the 1400s largely sank from view until his works were rediscovered in 1850.  </p><p>But the reason is not hard to find.  When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".

Lucky for me, one of my fellow jurors had a wife with some sway where she worked, and when the trial was done, I had a new job waiting for me. <br>It was meant to be. <br>I ended up with my dream job, and the trajectory of my life changed. <br>Life is unpredictable.<br>Finding the person who would be my best friend for the next forty years at that job was a bonus. <br>I\'m pretty glad now that I didn\'t duck jury duty.<br>Tonight\'s sunset looks like more rain on the horizon.<br><a href=""https://sfba.social/tags/Sunset"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>Sunset</span></a></p>LillyLyle/Count Melancholia<p>Chances that a cow steals your shoes are slim, but never zero  [h/t All Things Interesting]</p>Ars Technica<p>Unvaccinated Florida kids exposed to measles can skip quarantine, officials say</p><p>On Tuesday, nearly 20 percent of the school&#39;s 1,067 students were reportedly absent.</p><p><a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no""><span class=""invisible"">https://</span><span class=""ellipsis"">arstechnica.com/science/2024/0</span><span class=""invisible"">2/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social</span></a></p>Chris Hallbeck<p>[Radiohead Creep]</p><p>When you were here before<br />Couldn‚Äôt look you in the eye<br />You‚Äôre shaped like a bunny<br />Your foil makes me cry<br />You‚Äôre sold for $3.50<br />In a beautiful box<br />And I wish I was chocolate<br />You‚Äôre so full of chocolate<br />But I‚Äôm a peep<br />I‚Äôm marshmallow<br />What the hell am I doing here?<br />Wait until Easter</p>John Carlos Baez<p>At first glance it\'s amazing that one of the great British composers of the 1400s largely sank from view until his works were rediscovered in 1850.  </p><p>But the reason is not hard to find.  When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".

Even though I was working, had a side hustle as a seamstress, and had two young children, I ended up on a jury for a murder trial. What a stressful experience.<br>Because I did my civic duty and was off work for several weeks, I lost my job. Lucky for me, one of my fellow jurors had a wife with some sway where she worked, and when the trial was done, I had a new job waiting for me. <br>It was meant to be. <br>I ended up with my dream job, and the trajectory of my life changed. <br>Life is unpredictable.<br>Finding the person who would be my best friend for the next forty years at that job was a bonus. <br>I\'m pretty glad now that I didn\'t duck jury duty.<br>Tonight\'s sunset looks like more rain on the horizon.<br><a href=""https://sfba.social/tags/Sunset"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>Sunset</span></a></p>LillyLyle/Count Melancholia<p>Chances that a cow steals your shoes are slim, but never zero  [h/t All Things Interesting]</p>Ars Technica<p>Unvaccinated Florida kids exposed to measles can skip quarantine, officials say</p><p>On Tuesday, nearly 20 percent of the school&#39;s 1,067 students were reportedly absent.</p><p><a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no""><span class=""invisible"">https://</span><span class=""ellipsis"">arstechnica.com/science/2024/0</span><span class=""invisible"">2/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social</span></a></p>Chris Hallbeck<p>[Radiohead Creep]</p><p>When you were here before<br />Couldn‚Äôt look you in the eye<br />You‚Äôre shaped like a bunny<br />Your foil makes me cry<br />You‚Äôre sold for $3.50<br />In a beautiful box<br />And I wish I was chocolate<br />You‚Äôre so full of chocolate<br />But I‚Äôm a peep<br />I‚Äôm marshmallow<br />What the hell am I doing here?<br />Wait until Easter</p>John Carlos Baez<p>At first glance it\'s amazing that one of the great British composers of the 1400s largely sank from view until his works were rediscovered in 1850.  </p><p>But the reason is not hard to find.  When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".  It has long, sleek lines of harmony; you can lose yourself trying to follow all the parts.</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLrgI6-3I-s"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no"" target=""_blank""><span class=""invisible"">https://www.</span><span class=""ellipsis"">youtube.com/watch?v=qLrgI6-3I-</span><span class=""invisible"">s</span></a></p>Steve Silberman<p>This Doug Muir essay on the long-delayed death of the Voyager 1 spacecraft is an instant classic, one of the most gorgeously written <a href=""https://newsie.social/tags/science"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>science</span></a> pieces you\'ll read all year.

When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".

When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".

Lucky for me, one of my fellow jurors had a wife with some sway where she worked, and when the trial was done, I had a new job waiting for me. <br>It was meant to be. <br>I ended up with my dream job, and the trajectory of my life changed. <br>Life is unpredictable.<br>Finding the person who would be my best friend for the next forty years at that job was a bonus. <br>I\'m pretty glad now that I didn\'t duck jury duty.<br>Tonight\'s sunset looks like more rain on the horizon.<br><a href=""https://sfba.social/tags/Sunset"" class=""mention hashtag"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">#<span>Sunset</span></a></p>LillyLyle/Count Melancholia<p>Chances that a cow steals your shoes are slim, but never zero  [h/t All Things Interesting]</p>Ars Technica<p>Unvaccinated Florida kids exposed to measles can skip quarantine, officials say</p><p>On Tuesday, nearly 20 percent of the school&#39;s 1,067 students were reportedly absent.</p><p><a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"" translate=""no""><span class=""invisible"">https://</span><span class=""ellipsis"">arstechnica.com/science/2024/0</span><span class=""invisible"">2/unvaccinated-florida-kids-exposed-to-measles-can-skip-quarantine-officials-say/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_source=mastodon&amp;utm_medium=social</span></a></p>Chris Hallbeck<p>[Radiohead Creep]</p><p>When you were here before<br />Couldn‚Äôt look you in the eye<br />You‚Äôre shaped like a bunny<br />Your foil makes me cry<br />You‚Äôre sold for $3.50<br />In a beautiful box<br />And I wish I was chocolate<br />You‚Äôre so full of chocolate<br />But I‚Äôm a peep<br />I‚Äôm marshmallow<br />What the hell am I doing here?<br />Wait until Easter</p>John Carlos Baez<p>At first glance it\'s amazing that one of the great British composers of the 1400s largely sank from view until his works were rediscovered in 1850.  </p><p>But the reason is not hard to find.  When the Puritans took over England, they burned not only witches and heretics, but also books - and music!    They hated the complex polyphonic choral music of the Catholics.</p><p>So, in the history of British music, between the great polyphonists Robert Fayrfax (1465-1521) and John Taverner (1490‚Äì1545), there was a kind of gap - a silence - until the Peterhouse Partbooks were rediscovered.</p><p>These were an extensive collection of musical manuscripts, handwritten by single scribe between 1539 and 1541.   Most of them got lost somehow and were found only in the 1850s.  Others were found even later, in 1926!   They were hidden behind a panel in a library - probably hidden from Puritans.  </p><p>The 1850 batch contains wonderful compositions by Nicholas Ludford (~1485-1557).  One music scholar has called him ""one of the last unsung geniuses of Tudor polyphony"".  Another wrote:</p><p>""it is more a matter of astonishment that such mastery should be displayed by a composer of whom virtually nothing was known until modern times.""</p><p>Ludford\'s work was first recorded only in 1993, and much of the Peterhouse Partbooks have been recorded only more recently.   A Boston group called Blue Heron released a 5-CD set, starting in 2010 and ending in 2017.   It\'s magnificent!  </p><p>Here is the Sanctus from Nicholas Ludford\'s ""Missa Regnum mundi"".
